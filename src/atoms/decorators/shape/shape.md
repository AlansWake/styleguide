### General
Shape that scales with content. Is shaped like a square by default, but can have different shapes triggered by variant classes.

If used for displaying text it should not contain a lot of content, but rather small data points like tags.

Shape can be a link as well, you just need to fill the optional attribute "url". By default this link will open in a new window.
