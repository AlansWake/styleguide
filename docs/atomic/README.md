# Dividing patterns

## Metaphor

A car can be divided into parts, which then can be divided into smaller parts. If the parts are manufactured according to atomic design, the same parts can be used across different car models. Car models in this metaphor would be the organisms.

We can start by splitting out the wheel, the stereo and the motor. These would be the the molecules.

A stereo consists of nobs, speakers etc. A wheel consists of bolts, a rim and a tire. The motor can be split into many smaller parts for reuse as well. These parts would be the atoms.

All of the parts together is referenced as patterns. Pattern Lab contains a set of web patterns for showing them visually, and also for containing the style code for replicating the patterns in any web based system.

## Quick reference

### Atoms
- Smallest reusable part
- Car example: bolts, nobs, rim
- Web example: button, text-field, blockquote, logo

### Molecules
- Reusable set of two or more atoms
- Car example: stereo, wheel, motor
- Web example: figure with ficaption, calendar entry, logo with a description

### Organisms
- Component that completes a task on its own
- Car example: the car itself
- Web example: calendar, carousel, breadcrumbs
